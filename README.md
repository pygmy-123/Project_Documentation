## What Does MyPal Solve
mypal in its first version aimes to solve three problems:
1. Un-Useful alarms: where it is so easy to turn the alarm off that some people go to sleep again after it!
2. Falling asleep when working/sudying
3. all alarms look alike.

## How MyPal Solves this
using technologies such as face recognition and hand gesture reaeding we were able to do:
1. an alarm that turns off when you do a sequence of hand gestures or solve a mathematical equation
2. sleep detection: using this feature the cam analysis the opening of your eyes and if it detects that you slept by accident for longer than 5 seconds an alarm will go off to help you wake up!
3. We Used Tkinter-pycharm to create a simple and different GUI
